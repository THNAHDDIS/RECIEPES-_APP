Existing recipe websites often have cluttered interfaces, irrelevant search results, and effective filtering options. This leads to frustration for users who spend significant time browsing through countless recipes before finding something that suits their dietary needs, skill level, or available ingredients.

We need a user-friendly recipe discovery website that addresses these challenges by:
● Providing a clean and intuitive interface for easy browsing.
● Implementing effective filtering options based on cuisine, difficulty level, meal type,
and dietary restrictions.
● Offering a robust search functionality to find recipes by name or specific ingredients.
● Displaying clear and concise recipe information, including preparation and cooking
times, ingredients list, and detailed instructions.
● Add a feature to search/filter recipes
● Pagination
This website will empower users to discover delicious and suitable recipes quickly and
efficiently, ultimately enhancing their home cooking experience.
